                <h1>How To Get Rid Of Ticks And Fleas On Dogs</h1>
                <p>Ticks and fleas are the creepy crawly monsters that feature in most pet parents' nightmares. The mere
                    sight of one of these bloodthirsty insects latched onto your pet's skin is enough to cause a shiver
                    to run down your spine. But what are they really and why should we as pet parents care about them?Â

                    <h4>What are ticks and fleas?</h4>
                    <p>Ticks and fleas are two different types of parasites that commonly infect both cats and dogs.
                        They both bite and suck blood from their hosts and transmit diseases. The good news? There
                        are ways to get rid of these tick insect infestations and easy preventative measures that
                        can reduce the chance of a re-infestation!</p>
                    <p>Here's a little bit more about them both:</p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Ticks</h4>
                        <img src="images/pet_info_ticks1.png" height="300" width="300" alt="">
                        <h4>Appearance:</h4>
                        <p>Ticks look a lot like very small spiders. Once they latch onto your pet they feed off your
                            pet's blood.</p>
                        <h4>Diseases:</h4>
                        <p>There are hundreds of different species of ticks that can transmit diseases like Lyme disease
                            and tick-borne relapsing fever to your dog. There are also some specific ticks that can pass
                            on tick borne encephalitis.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Fleas</h4>
                        <img src="images/pet_info_ticks2.png" height="300" width="300" alt="">
                        <h4>Appearance:</h4>
                        <p>They are blackish-brown specks, smaller than ticks and they jump very quickly and high. To
                            test if your dog has fleas, place the flea dirt on a wet kitchen tissue and you'll see it
                            leaving red stains.</p>
                        <h4>Diseases:</h4>
                        <p>Fleas are another type of parasite that also freely roam in a number of different variants.
                            Although they are not commonly as lethal as ticks, they can pass on tapeworm and typhus.</p>

                <h3>Signs that your dog may have ticks and fleas</h3>
                <p>During the initial stages of the infestation, it might not be so obvious to spot these pests. These
                    are the signs you should be on the lookout for through the year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of itchiness and scratching around the head and ears</li>
                    <li>Red spots on your dog's skin may be from tick or flea bites</li>
                    <li>Signs of flea dirt (black-brown powdery substance in the fur)</li>
                    <li>Spotting a tick anywhere in your home (yes, even a single one)</li>
                    <li>Bumps or rashes (some dogs are allergic to tick bites)</li>

                <p>If you spot any of the above signs, you should immediately check your dog thoroughly for ticks or
                    other parasites. While fleas jump from one spot to another, ticks tend to stick to one place. Here
                    are few of their favourite spots you'll find them hiding in:</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p></p>Ticks are much easier to catch than fleas. Ticks move slower and are larger, often you
                        find them
                        with their mouth embedded into the skin. Here's how to get rid of ticks on dogs:</p>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>Spread the fur around the tick back so you have a clear space to work with.</li>
                            <li>Grasp the tick at a point that is as close to the skin as possible and pull it
                                out gently. This is so you don't tear the tick and leave any parts still stuck to the
                                skin.</li>
                            <li>Don't release the tick back into the environment or it will simply crawl back.</li>
                            <li>You can also kill it and drop it into a prepared solution of diluted disinfectant
                                (alcohol and vinegar).</li>
                            <li>Clean the bite area on your dog with a pet-safe antiseptic solution and wash your hands
                                well.</li>

                        </ol>

                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt><h4>Fleas</h4></dt>
                    <dd>Fleas are very fast and catching them by hand is quite tricky. You will have to do this as they
                        run through your pet's fur. Fleas can jump high and far as well so be prepared for this. Pet
                        parents generally find it easier to kill fleas by applying an anti-tick and flea massage oil and
                        then giving their dog an anti tick and flea shampoo bath with warm water. This may have to be
                        repeated every 10 days until the infestation is gone.</dd>
