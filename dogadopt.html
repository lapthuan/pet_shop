                <h1>How To Clean Dog Ears: At Home </h1>
                <p>Did you know that in India 62 million dogs are in shelters without a home or family of their own?
                    Prejudices against Indie dogs not only rob them of a loving home they deserve but also feed a cruel
                    breeding industry that is as unethical as it is illegal.
                    Now, there may be subjective reasons as to why Indie dogs often don't get the love and appreciation
                    they deserve, but the ones who have adopted Indies will tell you that they feel loved, fulfilled and
                    happy with their desi kids as any other devoted pet parent.</p>

                    <dt>Great Companions</dt>
                    <dd>Love knows no breed! Indie dogs can be just as loving and delightful as any other dog breed
                        out there. Every pet that you bring home will require effort from your end to adjust to your
                        lifestyle and the new surroundings and with a human willing to put in extra work and
                        adequate support, Indie dogs can be your best friend for life.

                    <dt>Protective & Loyal</dt>
                    <dd>Indie dogs are very protective of their pack and families. Not only do Indie dogs make great
                        companion pets, but their ability to sense danger and their fierce protective instincts also
                        make them very good at guarding their homes. Because of their guarding traits and agile
                        structure, Indie dogs have also been known to assist a few special task forces of the Indian
                        police.

                    <dt>Resilient & Adaptable</dt>
                    <dd>Indie dogs' tough physical attributes are a result of natural selection. This not only makes
                        them resilient but also less prone to health conditions as compared to other pedigree dogs.
                        Since they are also native to the Indian climate, most Indie dogs possess a short coat that
                        makes grooming very easy as well. With an appropriate diet, regular vaccinations and
                        adequate exercise, your decision of adopting an indie dog can be a blessing for both you and
                        your canine companion.

                    <dt>Promote Kindness</dt>
                    <dd>Breed prejudice is a real thing. The victim of this is both Indie dogs & pedigree dogs who
                        either face cruelty on the streets or unethical breeding practices. India is home to around
                        80 million homeless cats and dogs. Out of these, 9.1 million are stray cats, 62 million are
                        stray dogs and around 8.8 million are in shelters.Your decision to adopt an indie dog and
                        not shop will not only earn you a loving companion, but it will be a blessing for
                        overcrowded shelters and a step towards positive change in the world of pet parenting.

                    <dt>Highly Communicative</dt>
                    <dd>Indie dogs are naturally intelligent and very communicative. Once they are properly
                        socialised, they can get along well with other dogs as well. Their expressive nature makes
                        sure that you can never have a dull moment with them. Just like with every other dog, Indie
                        dogs have training requirements too, which can be an important factor in making them adjust
                        in your home. Indie dogs' communicative nature ensures that they can be easily trained and
                        their training progress can also be watched through changes in the way they communicate and
                        express themselves.
