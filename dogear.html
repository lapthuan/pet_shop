                    <p>
                        Ear-care is an essential part of your dog's grooming routine. Just like humans, dogs too produce
                        ear
                        wax
                        that needs to be treated at the right time in order to avoid an ear infection, general
                        discomfort or
                        allergies. 

                    </p>
                    <p>An ear-cleaning routine is also important for your dog's overall health and well-being. </p>

                    <h3>How To Clean A Dog's Ears At Home: 7 Easy Steps! </h3>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>If you have a medium or large dog, have them sitting or lying next to you in a comfortable
                            position.
                            If you have a small dog, it may be easier to have them sitting on your lap. If you find that
                            they
                            are fidgeting, let them find a comfortable spot for themselves.</li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Lift your dog's ear flap and hold it in the upright position between your thumb and
                            forefinger. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>While holding the tip of the bottle in the top of the ear canal, gently squeeze the
                            bottle to release the dog ear cleaning solution and fill the ear canal up, praising your dog
                            as
                            you
                            do so. It is very important to not insert the tip too far into your dog's ear. Ear cleaning
                            can
                            be a
                            stressful experience for your dogs. Reassuring them, slowing down the pace, and praising
                            them
                            can go
                            a long way in making the experience less stressful.

                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Massage the ear canal so you can hear the dog ear cleaning solution squelching. The
                            massaging will
                            break up the material at the bottom of the ear canal and allow it to float up to the top.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Any excess cleaner or debris found around the top of the ear can be wiped away using dog ear
                            wipes or cotton wool.</li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Praise your dog and give them some of their favourite dog treats. This will help reinforce
                            positive
                            feelings with getting their ears cleaned. You could also use a lick mat with some toppings
                            like
                            peanut butter, yogurt, broth to take a break and help your dogs feel calm. </li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Follow the same procedure with the second ear!</li>

                    <h3>Important Things To Be Aware Of</h3>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>DO NOT use cotton buds as there is a risk of putting them in too far and causing damage
                            inside
                            the
                            ear. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Never use the same piece of dog ear wipes or cotton wool in both ears</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If your dog is unhappy with you trying to clean the ears, then don't struggle as you may
                            cause
                            harm
                            to your dog or yourself. A qualified groomer or a nurse at the vets will be happy to help
                            you. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Look for calming (or stress) signals like lip licks, yawning, pawing. If you find that they
                            are
                            showing these too frequently or are moving away from you cleaning the ears, don't push
                            through.
                            It's
                            possible that they are experiencing pain or discomfort in their ears and wouldn't like for
                            you
                            to
                            touch them. Being able to read these signals will prevent any stress escalation and avoid
                            any
                            snapping incidents.

                        <li>If there is any unusual discharge or smell, contact your vet immediately before continuing.

                            <p>Use only a dog ear cleaning solution to clean your dog's ears. These bottles are
                                specifically
                                for dog's ears, so you are unlikely to cause trauma to the eardrum. A pet-friendly dog

                                wipes can be used for regular ear cleaning. Remember DO NOT use cotton buds as there is
                                a
                                risk
                                of putting them in too far and causing damage inside the ear. Avoid any home remedies
                                that
                                include any human products as they can be damaging to your dog's ears.

                            <h4>When is the best time for cleaning dog's ears?</h4>
                            <p>The best time to clean your dog's ears is when they are in a calm state of mind.
                                Sometimes
                                that
                                could be during grooming or bath time. Sometimes it could be outside of this. For some
                                dogs,
                                grooming or bathing is stressful enough. Add ear cleaning to that, and it could get very
                                strenuous for them. It is also important to check up on their ears once a month to
                                ensure
                                there
                                is no excess wax buildup. </p>

                            <h4>What are the symptoms for dog ear infection? </h4>
                            <p>Some symptoms of a dog ear infection include itching, scratching, head-tilts towards the
                                infected
                                ear, unusual odour or discharge and red, painful ears. If you notice any of these
                                symptoms,
                                contact your vet immediately.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>My vet has advised against cleaning my dog's ear? What should I do?</h4>
                            <p>Trust your vet. If your dog has damaged eardrums or inflammation of the ear canal, it is
                                recommended they do not get their ear cleaned as it can damage their ears further.
                                Hence, if
                                your vet has advised against cleaning your dog's ear, follow their specific
                                instructions. If
                                you
                                wish, you can get a second opinion from another trusted vet. </p>

                            <p>If your dog is unhappy with you trying to clean the ears, then don't struggle as you may
                                cause
                                harm to your dog or yourself. Instead, reach out to a qualified groomer or a nurse at
