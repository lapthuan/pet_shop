                <h1> The Importance of Greens for Cats</h1>
                <p>There goes Bee, my thirteen-year-old siamese-like kitty, dashing out the door and down the hill to
                    munch on the brand spankin’ new, soft, chartreuse spikes of grass coming in next to the creek.
                    Pretty much every cat that has lived with me has been a grass-grazer. We have also known felines that
                    couldn’t give a rat’s a– about anything green!
                    If you haven’t already, open yourself up to the wonderful world of feline grasses, greens, and
                    veggies, especially, if you have a strictly indoor kitty companion!
                    While cats are obligate carnivores, there are several theories as to why they chow down on grass.
                    Perhaps they eat grass because it provides an enzyme that allows them to digest other vegetables in
                    the guts of their ‘kills,’ or to make themselves throw up, eliminating unwanted contents in their
                    stomach such as hair. Perhaps it’s because grass contains nutrients such as folic acid or it could
                    help remedy and prevent constipation. One final hypothesis is that greens for cats can help to rid
                    them of intestinal parasites by physically scrubbing the walls of the gut. So, while they may not
                    NEED it, grass is a great source of fiber and can help improve digestion, while removing any
                    indigestible materials they may have taken in.</p>

                <h3>Do we, think it’s a good idea to give your purr-bucket something
                    green to munch on, especially if they live inside? Heck yeah!</h3>
                <p>Even if your feline is an indoor/outdoor cat, offering her bits of kitty salad is lovely and will be
                    much appreciated.
                    Wheatgrass is the most common type of grass sold as ‘Cat Grass.’ This variety is a wonderful source
                    of vitamins E and B-6, riboflavin, niacin, manganese, zinc, and pantothenic acid. A combination of
                    Wheat/Oat grass is also a commonplace mixture. Some folks claim their cat prefers lemongrass to any
                    other plant! You can grow your mini-lawn yourself, or, if you lack a green thumb, there are ‘cat
                    grass’ kits available at your local pet food store. If you choose to set up and cultivate your
                    kitty’s grass plot, light and warmth will help them grow bigger and healthier. If you happen to have
                    too little natural light, the situation can be remedied with grow lights. These grasses must be kept
                    short by either the kitty “mowers” or you and your hand clippers.
                    Sunvet Animal Wellness Clinic clients that don’t grow grass for their purr-buddies will often pick
                    up our Barley Cat. This gently dehydrated barley grass powder is loaded with active enzymes that are
                    often missing in processed cat foods. Sprinkling Barley Cat on your cat’s food will not only enhance
                    the taste but may also enhance nutrient absorption. I always suggest starting your feline on ¼ the
                    suggested dose, so she can become familiar with the new taste.</p>

                <h3>CATS AND HOUSEPLANTS</h3>
                <p>Ferns such as the Boston fern and maidenhair fern are safe, as are most palms. Blooming plants such as
                    the African violet, African daisy, and orchids won’t harm your cat if she takes a bite. Safe green
                    plants include coleus, corn plant, dracaena, and spider plant. If you supply your beautiful panther with
                    edible houseplants, be sure that you’re not using chemicals on the plants or in the soil (some cats love
                    to dig in dirt) that your cat could accidentally ingest. You will find the link to ASPCA’s list of toxic
                    and non-toxic plants for dogs and cats here.
                    For those of you that like to share your lovely food with your mouser, there are a few ways to approach
                    serving veggies. Superb vegetables to offer your cat are chopped carrots, peas, frozen corn, broccoli
                    florets, green beans, zucchini, lettuce, spinach, winter squash, and pumpkin. This produce should be
                    cooked (steamed is best) since felines, just like us humans, lack a sufficient way to break down plant
                    cell walls. An added bonus to feeding bits of winter squash or pumpkin is that they contain a bacteria
                    that, when eaten in moderation, can actually help normalize your kitty’s bowel environment and relieve
                    constipation or diarrheal issue. Green beans, with their natural fiber, are a perfect snack for your
                    overweight Tom.</p>
